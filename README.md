# ENC

### Summary
ENC is a free standalone Python code base encryption utility. This utility is designed to create a single runnable unit out of multiple Python modules and is intended to help anyone looking to create closed source Python applications.

---
### Get the code
The easiest way to get the code is simply to clone this repository to your local machine!

---
### Requirements
- Python 2.7.x
- Pip
	- astunparse 1.4+
	- cement 2.10+
	- pycrypto 2.6+

Once you have acquired the code you only need to make sure you have the required modules installed. The can be easily accomplished using pip. Simply run `pip install -r requirements.txt` with the included requirements.txt file and the required files will be downloaded over the Internet from the Python package index.

### How it works

ENC has two main parts. The first part `enc.py` is the encryption tool and does the work of actually creating and outputting an encrypted unit. The second part `run.py` is tool that executes the encrypted unit.

`enc.py` can be run on one or more Python modules to create a single, encrypted, runnable unit. ENC is designed to protect applications *not* libraries/modules for import (though this functionality will hopefully be added in the future). This roughly translates to "you need to have an entry point in your program." This is necessary because ENC will prompt you for a password and then *begin running* your encrypted unit. `enc.py` has various options for specifying how your Python code will be stored in an encrypted unit. For example, the output unit can either be stored as a native Python AST object or as raw Python code (both encrypted) and can be compressed for a more compact representation on disk. ENC makes extensive use of Python Abstract Syntax Trees to intelligently re-write portions of your program that would otherwise inhibit you from joining together multiple Python scripts. `enc.py` only encrypts the files you tell it to and does not effect any imports in your program. If you for example, used the *time* module in a program (`import time`), `enc.py` will not encrypt `time.py` without explicitly being told to do so.

`run.py` can decrypt and run any encrypted unit generated by `enc.py`. Simply specify the encrypted unit you wish to run, enter your password when prompted and `run.py` will decrypt your file and begin executing your program. `run.py` can execute programs that use command line parameters, this was tested with both `argparse` and directly through `sys.argv`.

### Quick start (how to run it)

ENC is extremely generic and can be used in many ways. Most often ENC is run as a standalone or inside a Jenkins build process. Because ENC has a CLI it can be easily adapted for many projects.

To see ENC in action simply run the utility over some Python files as follows:
`python enc.py -e file_with_entry_point.py -s file_with_entry_point.py another_required_module.py -p admin -o unit.enc -c`
This will create a single encrypted unit called `unit.enc` comprised of files `file_with_entry_point.py` and `another_required_module.py` with the password `admin` and stored as a compressed Python AST object.

This will output a file called 'unit.enc' which can then be easily run with `run.py` as follows:
`python run.py unit.enc`
Any required command line parameters can be passed as additional arguments to `run.py` like so:
`python run.py unit.enc --additional-parameter xxx`

Try running ENC on the files in the examples directory:
- entry.py - the file containing the program entry point
- aux.py - an additional file required by entry.py
- another.py - another file required by entry.py

Before trying ENC, run the example as follows:
<br /> `python entry.py` <br /> and <br />
`python entry.py helloWorld`
to familiarize yourself with the output of the program. Now try the same thing using ENC.

This can be done using the following commands:
<br />`python $ENC_HOME/enc.py -e entry.py -s entry.py aux.py another.py -o test.enc -p admin -c`
<br />`python $ENC_HOME/run.py test.enc`
<br />or
<br />`python $ENC_HOME/run.py test.enc helloWorld`
<br />enter `admin` and you will see the same output as before!

Note that there is no way to return an encrypted unit to its decrypted state if you forget the password, be sure to keep it safe.

### ENC quick reference

To see the built in help menu simply run:
`python enc.py -h`

**enc.py**

| Flag | Long Flag | Effect | Required|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| -h | --help | Show help message and exit | N |
| | --quiet | Suppress all output | N |
| -e ENTRY | --entry ENTRY | Specify file as application entry point | Y |
| -s [SOURCE [SOURCE ...]] | --source [SOURCE [SOURCE ...]] | Space separated list of source files to be encrypted | Y |
| -p PASSWORD | --password PASSWORD | Password/secret used to encrypt source files | Y |
| -o OUTPUT | --output OUTPUT | Specify output path and filename | N |
| -t {a,r} | --type {a,r} | Store as an AST object (default, for compatibility) or store as raw code (file size) | N |
| -c | --compress | Compress output format for reduced file size (zlib) | N |
| -d | --debugOutput | Prints the approximate source code that will be placed into the runnable unit (before encryption) | N |

Note: `--debug` and `--debugOutput` are not equivalent. The first is `enc.py` level debugging, and the second is a preview of what `enc.py` will output for a single runnable unit. This is extremely useful if you are having problems encrypting your program. For example you can simply run:
`python enc.py -e hello.py -s hello.py -p admin -d > run_this.py`
This will dump the joined source to a file in clear text. You can then locally run:
`python run_this.py` to figure out what is going wrong. 

Functionality to allow you to 're-submit' a corrected merged source file is coming very very soon!

### Using ENC for your own projects
Anyone is welcome to use ENC for their own projects provided that you adhere to the GPL 3.0 license included with the software! Its not required but I would also appreciate it if you would mention this project in your source!

---
### Contribute fixes and features
ENC is completely open source and I welcome anyone who would like to contribute to the project. If you're interested in contributing please contact me and/or submit a pull request! I plan to make a number of updates to the code myself, including performance increases, style refactoring and some new features but I can't do it all myself!
